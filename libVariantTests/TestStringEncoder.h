//
// PURPOSE:
//  This libVariant library allows one to create an instance of Variant class.
//  The Variant class allows one to create a type-safe and value safe union
//  between all known c++ basic types. An instance of a Variant class can hold
//  any c++ type of value and can easily convert between any type of data when
//  required.  The class automatically handles all conversion combinations and
//  minimizes lost of data. Typically used in design where one does not want
//  to implement conversion of c++ types using templates in every situation.
//  Variant instance can be used to implement a similar fashion of C# properties
//  where property editors can edit any type of property.
//
// HISTORY:
// 10/29/2016 v1.0 - Initial release.
// 05/26/2017 v2.0 - Updated API for cleaner look & updated documentation.
//                 - Added speed optimizations.
//                 - Added more operators: +, -, *, /, +=, -=, *=, /=, <, >, <=, >=, == and !=
//                 - Implemented division by zero handling.
